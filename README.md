# Carten100 Live Tracker

Welcome! This site is a live tracker for my ride in the [CARTEN100](https://www.carten100.com/) on May 10th, 2025—a 100-mile challenge from Cardiff to Tenby, all in one day.

## What is this?

- **Live Map:**  
  Watch my real-time location as I cycle the Carten100 route. The map updates live from my phone, so you can see exactly where I am on the course.

- **Support Wall (coming soon):**  
  Leave messages, cheer me on, and upload photos. Your support keeps me going!

- **Fundraising Progress (coming soon):**  
  See live updates from my JustGiving page, track how much we've raised, and help push us to the next milestone.

## Why?

This project is for friends, family, and anyone interested in following my journey and supporting the charities helped by Carten100.  
It's not a race—just a big ride for a good cause.

## How it works

- My phone sends my location to a secure server.
- The website updates the map instantly, so you always see my latest position.
- Soon, you'll be able to post messages and photos, and see live fundraising stats.

## Get Involved

- **Track me:** Just watch the map!
- **Send support:** (Feature coming soon) Leave a message or photo.
- **Donate:** (Feature coming soon) See my JustGiving page and help us raise more for charity.
